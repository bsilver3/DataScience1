  HOLLYWOOD'S GENDER DIVIDE AND ITS EFFECT ON FILMS

  EXAMINING THE GENDER OF WRITERS, PRODUCERS, AND DIRECTORS WHO MAKE FILMS THAT FAIL THE BECHDEL TEST

  <p>
    There's this thing called the Bechdel Test. It measures just how male-dominated our beloved Netflix nights really are. To pass,
    films need to satisfy three requirements.<br>

    <p>
        <b>
            <ol style="text-align: center; list-style-position: inside; margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <li><b>It has at least two women in it</b></li>
                <li><b>Who talk to each other, about</b></li>
                <li><b>Something besides a man</b></li>
            </ol>
        </b>
    </p>
        
  </p>

    It's a low bar, but many good movies don't pass. <i>Birdman</i> fails. <i>Avatar</i> fails. Fucking <i>Toy Story fails</i>. On 
    <a href="http://bechdeltest.com/">bechdeltest.com</a>, a site for crowdsourcing Bechdel Test results, about <b>40%</b> of films don't pass.
    It's a sad state since women exist in life, like, half the time.

    Why? Rather than generalize a sexist system, one theory is simple: filmmakers, unintentionally, make movies about themselves (i.e., 
    write what you know). Since the most powerful producers, writers, and directors are men, male-themes permeate into Hollywood's output.
    To see if women (i.e., pass the Bechdel test), we compiled the genders of the producers, writers, and directors on thousands of films.

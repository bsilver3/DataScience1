      <p>
          Chronostasis is a phenomenon where it feels like you are “stopped in time”. 
          This generally occurs when your brain has to overcorrect after an eye movement. 
          When analyzing the data, we can see that there is a positive association between velocity and amplitude, 
          meaning that the faster somebody moves their eye, the more likely they are to experience a chronostasis phenomenon, 
          due to their eye using more force and having to overcorrect. I calculated the amount of people with an amplitude above 20.0, 
          which is the amplitude that it generally takes to have a substantial amount of correction in the brain. 
          I then calculated the percentage of people who had the experience of chronostasis, 
          and I found that 1.84% of people experience chronostasis in daily life. 
          However, this can easily be manipulated by intensely focusing on a point, and then quickly shifting your focus to another object, 
          such as a clock. If the second hand seems to freeze for a second, then you have experienced a form of chronostasis.

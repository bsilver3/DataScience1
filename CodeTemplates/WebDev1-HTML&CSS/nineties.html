        Let's warp to the mid-90s, when labels began to play a new role in hip hop under the tutelage of Puff Daddy
        with Bad Boy and Suge Knight/Dre with Death Row.

        In 1989, regional independent labels dominated with superstar signings: Young MC and the Pharcyde are signed to Delicious Vinyl.
        Biz Markie (Just a Friend), Big Daddy Kane (Smooth Operator), and Marley Marl are all on Cold Chillin'. Ruthless, Eazy E's label, 
        has N.W.A. and The D.O.C. on its roster. Jive is crushing it with a roster that includes Boogie Down Productions, DJ Jazzy Jeff
        and the Fresh Prince, and Too $hort. And Tommy Boy presciently released both De La Soul and Queen Latifah's first albums.

            Beginning in '94, Bad Boy and Death Row began to compete with major labels for artists. Puff Daddy used his experience at Uptown
            and with artists such as Heavy D to launch Bad Boy, releasing rap albums with both underground and pop potential (eg. Notorious B.I.G., 
            Craig Mack). Bad Boy's growth was followed by its feud with Death Row (Dre, 2pac), forever changing the role of labels in hip hop.
            Labels were not only the business-side of hip hop, but now a regional collective of artists who represent an identity and philosophy
            towards hip hop.

            During the mid-90s, a number of notable labels launched and gained notoriety:

            The weird thing is that it's only Young Money. For the past 25 years, there's always been mega-popular labels (e.g., 
            Shady/Aftermath, Rawkus, No Limit, Bad Boy) - there were just more of them at one time. This is the

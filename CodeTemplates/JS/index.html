                Cities have long been havens for queer individuals. Decades before the "We're here! We're queer!" activism of the 1960s and 1970s,
                cities were a refuge for those society had kicked out. And today, they still serve as the North Star for many LGBTQ youth
                across the country.<br>

                Over time, this queer city migration helped form direct enclaves, or "gayborhoods." Today, they are often marked by rainbow
                crosswalks and strips of business flying Pride flags, but beyond the obvious markers, how do we measure these queer spaces?
                And more importantly, who gets included?
